# MathPractice
A JavaScript-based generator for math practice sheets.

Use this to generate either 5-by-5 or 6-by-6 sheets of arithmetic problems. You can set which operators(s) to use and how high the numbers/answers can be.

I made this script because my children are in a great program called Math Facts Scholars, which improves their skills by having them take weekly tests that get progressively harder. I started with code by [Dr. Drang](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2008/01/math-practice-sheet-in-html-and-javascript/) and improved on it until it was no longer based on his code. Generating these practice sheets has been extremely helpful for homeschooling.

## How to use
1. Put **CustomPractice.htm** and **Practice.htm** in the same folder.
2. Open **CustomPractice.htm** in a browser (tested in Firefox and Chrome). 

Alternatively, an online version can be found at my web site, [CatholicFamily.Fun](http://www.catholicfamily.fun/math).

##Ongoing development
I plan to continue to update the script whenever my children reach a new level that requires a new kind of practice sheet. Fractions should not be far away. At some point, I hope to add basic algebra too.
